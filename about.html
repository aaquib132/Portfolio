    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>I am an aspiring MERN Stack Developer with a strong foundation in full-stack web development, database management, and software engineering. Skilled in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, I enjoy building dynamic, user-friendly, and scalable web applications.
        <br>
<br>
My journey includes developing projects such as a Bank Management System, a Book Recommendation System, and a Deepfake Video Detection system, which strengthened my expertise in both backend logic and frontend integration.
<br>
<br>
I also contributed to Urban Nest (My Perfect PG & GharDwaar), a student housing and rental platform, where I gained practical exposure to startup operations, product development, and real-world problem solving.
<br>
<br>
Passionate about creating impactful digital solutions, I am continuously learning and exploring new technologies to grow as a versatile full-stack developer.</p>
